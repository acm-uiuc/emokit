The data is present in duplicate.

csv files -- the original data
arff files -- labeled data (to make it easier to load into weka)
 - labels are as follows:
  - rest 		= rest
	- barmup 	= both arms up
	- rarmup 	= right arm up
	- larmup 	= left arm up

Note, none of the data is processed in any way.
